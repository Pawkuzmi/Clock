# Clock
Clock with calendar - Java
This simple program shows current date and hour. In extension there is tile view of days in current month. There is a possibility of clicking on chosen tile and adding or deleting event in selected day.
I created this calendar because I wanted to write some application that would be useful for me. Moreover I wanted to create my first simple database.
This project uses Java swing library and SQLite.
